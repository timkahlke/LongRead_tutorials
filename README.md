This repo provides the page sources, data and figures for entry-level bioinformatics tutorials for long-read data analysis. The actual github pages for the tutorials can be found at https://timkahlke.github.io/LongRead_tutorials/.

The tutorials were initially created for the *[Long-Read long reach sequencing workshop](https://cba.anu.edu.au/news-events/long-read-long-reach-sequencing-workshop)* held November 11th-15th at the Australian National University based on material I developed for previous MinION workshops. I will keep updating these tutorials for future courses and whenever I find the time to do so.
